## üöÄ Best Practices

### Query Optimization
1. **Use @organization** to target specific orgs (reduces results by ~99%)
2. **Be specific** with device types and names
3. **Use natural language** - the system understands context
4. **Combine filters** for precise results

### Security Notes
- All queries are **READ-ONLY**
- Passwords show metadata only, never actual credentials
- Sensitive data requires IT Glue direct access
- All queries are logged for audit purposes

### Examples of Effective Queries
```
@faucets firewall IP address
@faucets who manages the main server
@faucets switch configuration details
@faucets admin password last changed
@faucets server serial numbers
@faucets contact phone numbers
@faucets network documentation
```
