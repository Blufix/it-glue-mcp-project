# Project Brief: IT Glue MCP Server - Intelligent Documentation Query System

## Executive Summary

**Product Concept:** An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that transforms IT Glue's unstructured, siloed documentation into an intelligent, instantly-accessible knowledge base through natural language querying.

**Primary Problem:** IT Glue documentation has grown organically across multiple company libraries, making critical fixes, passwords, and configurations difficult to find, leading to inefficient support operations and knowledge silos.

**Target Market:** Managed Service Providers (MSPs) and IT departments using IT Glue for documentation management, specifically technical support teams needing rapid access to client infrastructure information.

**Key Value Proposition:** Zero-hallucination natural language queries that instantly surface accurate IT documentation across company boundaries, reducing mean time to resolution (MTTR) by eliminating manual documentation searches.

## Problem Statement

### Current State and Pain Points
- **Organic Growth Chaos:** IT Glue documentation has evolved without structure, with fixes randomly documented across different company libraries
- **Search Limitations:** Native IT Glue search requires exact terminology and doesn't understand context or variations in phrasing
- **Knowledge Silos:** Each company's library is isolated, preventing cross-company knowledge mining for similar issues
- **Multiple Password Entries:** Credentials scattered across various locations without clear organization
- **Hidden Solutions:** Valuable fixes and workarounds buried in unstructured documentation, invisible to those who need them

### Impact of the Problem
- Support technicians spend 15-30 minutes searching for information per ticket
- Critical fixes documented for one client aren't discoverable for similar issues at other clients
- New technicians struggle to onboard without tribal knowledge of where information lives
- Increased escalations due to inability to find existing solutions

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short
- IT Glue's web interface requires users to know exact locations and terminology
- No semantic understanding of queries (searching "printer IP" won't find "printer address")
- Cannot query relationships between components
- No cross-company intelligence capabilities

### Urgency
With MSPs managing increasing numbers of clients and IT environments growing more complex, the inability to quickly access accurate documentation directly impacts:
- Customer satisfaction (longer resolution times)
- Technician productivity (time wasted searching)
- Knowledge retention (solutions not being reused)

## Proposed Solution

### Core Concept
Build an MCP server that acts as an intelligent layer between IT Glue's API and chat interfaces, using:
- **Neo4j** for modeling IT infrastructure relationships
- **Qdrant** for semantic search understanding
- **Zero-hallucination validation** ensuring 100% accuracy

### Key Differentiators
1. **Natural Language Understanding:** Ask questions in plain English ("What's Company A's router IP?")
2. **Cross-Company Intelligence:** Find similar fixes across all clients, not just within one company
3. **Relationship Awareness:** Understand connections between assets, configurations, and dependencies
4. **Strict Accuracy:** Returns "no data available" rather than guessing or hallucinating

### Why This Solution Will Succeed
- Leverages existing IT Glue data without migration
- Uses proven technologies (Neo4j for relationships, Qdrant for semantic search)
- MCP protocol ensures compatibility with any chat interface
- Local deployment using available infrastructure (no cloud dependencies)

### High-Level Vision
Transform IT Glue from a documentation repository into an intelligent knowledge system that understands context, relationships, and intent, making every technician as effective as the most experienced team member.

- **Hosting/Infrastructure:** Docker Compose on local infrastructure, potential k8s for scale

### Architecture Considerations
- **Repository Structure:** Monorepo with clear separation of concerns (API, MCP server, UI)
- **Service Architecture:** Microservices pattern with MCP server, sync service, query engine
- **Integration Requirements:** IT Glue API, future webhooks for real-time updates
- **Security/Compliance:** API key management, data encryption at rest, audit logging, GDPR compliance

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints
- **Budget:** Utilizing existing local infrastructure (no cloud costs for MVP)
- **Timeline:** 6-week MVP deadline
- **Resources:** Single development team with AI assistance
- **Technical:** IT Glue API rate limits, no webhook support currently

### Key Assumptions
- IT Glue API provides sufficient data granularity
- Local infrastructure can handle expected query load
- Semantic search will accurately understand IT terminology
- Users will adopt natural language querying quickly
- Data sync frequency of 15 minutes is acceptable

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks
