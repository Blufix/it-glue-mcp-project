# Document Cleanup Plan - Accuracy Improvement Strategy

**Goal:** Improve documentation accuracy from 2/10 to 9/10 by removing misleading content

## üóëÔ∏è Documents Recommended for DELETION

### **PRIORITY 1: DELETE IMMEDIATELY** - Dangerously Inaccurate

#### 1. `docs/fullstack-architecture.md` ‚ùå DELETE
**Why Delete:**
- References "MVP Streamlit frontend" but you have sophisticated UI with @org commands
- Shows outdated microservices architecture not matching current monorepo
- Mermaid diagrams showing wrong service relationships
- **Risk:** New developers will build wrong mental model

#### 2. `docs/backend-architecture.md` ‚ùå DELETE
**Why Delete:**
- 85KB of outdated architectural decisions
- Missing all your specialized MCP query handlers
- References wrong database patterns
- Shows generic Python API instead of sophisticated MCP server

#### 3. `docs/frontend-architecture.md` ‚ùå DELETE
**Why Delete:**
- 50KB describing generic Streamlit patterns
- Missing @organization command system
- No mention of chat interface or query processing
- Wrong UI architecture assumptions

#### 4. `docs/user-guide.md` ‚ùå DELETE
**Why Delete:**
- Shows generic API endpoints that don't exist
- No Streamlit UI instructions
- Missing MCP protocol usage
- Completely wrong user experience description

#### 5. `docs/deployment-guide.md` ‚ùå DELETE & REPLACE
**Why Delete:**
- 30KB of Kubernetes/Cloud deployment (not implemented)
- Wrong Docker configuration
- Missing your actual 6-service setup
- **Replace with:** Simple Docker Compose guide

### **PRIORITY 2: DELETE OR MERGE** - Redundant/Confusing

#### 6. `docs/api-integration-specification.md` ‚ùå DELETE
**Why Delete:**
- 37KB of generic API patterns
- Your IT Glue integration is in `src/services/itglue/client.py`
- Redundant with brownfield architecture

#### 7. `docs/implementation-guide.md` ‚ö†Ô∏è DELETE & REPLACE
**Why Delete Current:**
- 30KB of outdated implementation steps
- **Replace with:** Simple setup guide based on actual Docker Compose

#### 8. `docs/development-workflow-guide.md` ‚ö†Ô∏è MERGE INTO README
**Why Merge:**
- 35KB mostly about generic Python development
- Merge useful parts into main README
- Delete the rest

### **PRIORITY 3: CONSOLIDATE** - Overlapping Content

#### 9. Multiple Architecture Documents ‚Üí Keep Only 1
**Delete:**
- `docs/IT-Glue-Query-Enhancement-Architecture.md`
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md`
- `docs/DATA_FLOW_DIAGRAM.md`

**Keep:** `docs/brownfield-architecture.md` (current and accurate)

#### 10. Multiple Testing Documents ‚Üí Keep Only 1
**Delete:**
- `docs/testing-documentation.md` (45KB of generic testing)
**Keep:** `docs/mcp-tool-testing.md` (current MCP-specific testing)

## ‚úÖ Documents to KEEP (Accurate/Useful)

### **Core Current Documentation**
- `README.md` ‚úÖ **KEEP** - Accurate project overview
- `docs/brownfield-architecture.md` ‚úÖ **KEEP** - Current system state
- `CLAUDE.md` ‚úÖ **KEEP** - AI development workflow
- `docs/mcp-tool-testing.md` ‚úÖ **KEEP** - Current testing procedures

### **Recent Implementation Documentation**
- `docs/TRIPLE_DATABASE_INTEGRATION.md` ‚úÖ **KEEP** - Database architecture
- `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_FIXES_REFERENCE.md` ‚úÖ **KEEP** - Bug fixes and solutions
- `docs/FAUCETS_DOCUMENT_EXTRACTION.md` ‚úÖ **KEEP** - Specific implementation details
- `docs/stories/epic-1.1-database-integration-mcp-tools.md` ‚úÖ **KEEP** - Current epic

### **Reference Materials**
- `docs/IT_GLUE_API_LIMITATIONS.md` ‚úÖ **KEEP** - Important constraints
- `docs/bug-report-query-tool-filtering.md` ‚úÖ **KEEP** - Known issues
- `.env.example` ‚úÖ **KEEP** - Configuration reference

## üìä Cleanup Impact

### **Before Cleanup:**
- **35+ files** (overwhelming)
- **Accuracy: 2/10** (dangerously misleading)
- **~500KB** of outdated content

### **After Cleanup:**
- **~15 files** (focused and manageable)
- **Target Accuracy: 9/10** (reliable information)
- **~100KB** of current, accurate content

## üéØ Replacement Strategy

### **Instead of Deleting Everything, Create Minimal Replacements:**

#### 1. `docs/QUICK_START.md` (NEW)
Replace 5 outdated guides with:
```markdown
# Quick Start Guide

## 1. Setup (5 minutes)
- Clone repo
- `cp .env.example .env` (add IT Glue API key)
- `docker-compose up -d`
- `poetry install && poetry run python -m src.mcp`

## 2. Access
- Streamlit UI: http://localhost:8501
- Use @organization commands
- MCP tools available via protocol

## 3. Architecture
See: docs/brownfield-architecture.md
```

#### 2. `docs/DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md` (NEW)
Replace deployment guide with:
```markdown
# Docker Deployment

## Services (6 total)
- PostgreSQL: Structured data
- Redis: Caching
- Qdrant: Vector search
- Neo4j: Graph (provisioned)
- Prometheus: Metrics
- Grafana: Dashboards

## Commands
- `docker-compose up -d` - Start all
- `docker-compose logs -f` - Monitor
- See .env.example for configuration
```

## üö® Execution Plan

### **Phase 1: IMMEDIATE DELETION** (Today)
Delete the 5 most dangerous files:
```bash
rm docs/fullstack-architecture.md
rm docs/backend-architecture.md  
rm docs/frontend-architecture.md
rm docs/user-guide.md
rm docs/deployment-guide.md
```

### **Phase 2: CLEANUP** (This Week)
```bash
rm docs/api-integration-specification.md
rm docs/implementation-guide.md
rm docs/development-workflow-guide.md
rm docs/testing-documentation.md
rm docs/IT-Glue-Query-Enhancement-Architecture.md
```

### **Phase 3: CREATE REPLACEMENTS** (Next Week)
- Create `docs/QUICK_START.md`
- Create `docs/DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md`
- Update `docs/README.md` with new structure

## ‚úÖ Quality Gates

### **Before any deletion:**
1. ‚úÖ Confirm brownfield-architecture.md covers the essential info
2. ‚úÖ Ensure README.md has quick start info
3. ‚úÖ Verify .env.example has all config needed

### **After cleanup:**
1. New developer can get system running in <10 minutes
2. Architecture questions answered by brownfield doc
3. No conflicting information between documents
4. Documentation accuracy > 8/10

## üìã Benefits of This Cleanup

### **Immediate Benefits:**
- ‚ùå **Remove confusion** - No more conflicting architecture info
- ‚ö° **Faster onboarding** - Clear path to get system running
- üéØ **Focused documentation** - Only current, accurate information

### **Long-term Benefits:**
- üìä **Higher accuracy** - Target 9/10 instead of 2/10
- üîß **Easier maintenance** - Fewer files to keep current
- üë• **Better developer experience** - Reliable information

**Key Principle:** Better to have 10 accurate documents than 35 misleading ones!
